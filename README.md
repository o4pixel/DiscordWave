## Overview

DiscordWave is an asynchronous Python library that provides a clean, intuitive interface to the Discord API. It's designed to be easy to use while still offering powerful features for creating Discord bots.

## Features

- üöÄ **Simple and intuitive**: Clean API design with sensible defaults
- ‚ö° **Fully asynchronous**: Built with `asyncio` for high performance
- üõ†Ô∏è **Command framework**: Easy to create and manage commands
- üîß **Event-driven architecture**: Register handlers for Discord events
- üß© **Minimal dependencies**: Only requires a few external packages

## Installation

```bash
pip install discordwave
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of a bot that responds to a "!ping" command:

```python
from discordwave import Client, Intents

# Initialize with required intents
bot = Client(token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", intents=Intents.default())

@bot.command()
async def ping(message, args):
    """Simple ping command"""
    await message.reply("Pong! üèì")

# Start the bot
bot.run()
```

## Creating a Bot

1. Create an application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Add a bot to your application
3. Copy your bot token
4. Invite the bot to your server using the OAuth2 URL generator
5. Run your bot with the token

## Documentation

### Client

The main interface to Discord:

```python
client = Client(token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", intents=Intents.default())
```

### Intents

Control which events your bot receives:

```python
# Only receive message events
intents = Intents(messages=True, message_content=True)

# Receive all events (requires privileged intents)
intents = Intents.all()
```

### Commands

Register commands easily with decorators:

```python
@bot.command(name="greet", description="Greets a user")
async def greet_command(message, args):
    await message.reply(f"Hello, {message.author.username}!")
```

### Events

Listen for Discord events:

```python
@bot.event("guild_create")
async def on_guild_join(guild_data):
    print(f"Bot added to a new guild: {guild_data['name']}")
```
